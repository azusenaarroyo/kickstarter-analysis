# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis is to provide crowdfunding analysis on 4,113 crowdfunding campaigns 

### Purpose
Provide data driven recommendations on successful, failed, and cancelled crowdfunding campaigns

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
I created a pivot table to analyze the relationship between theater crowdfunding campaigns and their launch date by month

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
I created a pivot table to analyze relationship between play crowdfunding campaign goals and outcomes

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
I came across challenges in my COUNTIF equation where I made mistakes of the direction of the arrow of my angle brackets. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
The most successful theater campaigns launched in the month of May. The least successful theater campaigns launched in the month of December.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Most of the play campaigns had a goal range of $1,000 to $4,999 and 73% of those campaigns met their goal. The only other goal range with a higher rate of success at 76% was that with the goal of less than $1,000. Therefore, the most successful campaigns had goals between $0-$4,999.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
