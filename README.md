# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis is to provide crowdfunding analysis on 4,113 crowdfunding campaigns 

### Purpose
Provide data analysis on crowdfunding campaigns around the world to help determine succesful implementation of a crowdfundung campaign

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
I created a pivot table to analyze the outcomes of theater crowdfunding campaigns and launch date by month

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
I came across challenges in my COUNTIF equation where I made mistakes of the direction of the angle brackets which was yielding wrong results. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
The most successful theater campaigns launched in the month of May. The least successful theater campaigns launched in the month of December.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
The highest number of successful campaigns had a goal of $1,000 to $4,999. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
Data set may not be representative of total campaigns in the world
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
We could create a graph representing data of theater crowdfunding campaigns in the US and goals to get a more respresentative sample. In addition, adding a new criteria for country in our outcomes and goals worksheet to narrow in on campaigns goals in the US.
